# Doka

## Setup

Go to your projects root directory, create a `.doka.env` file and clone the repository

`git clone https://github.com/RozbehSharahi/doka`

## Now you can

`doka/compose up -d`

## Good to know

Set on your `.doka.env` APACHE_DOCUMENT_ROOT and rebuild `doka/compose build` in order to configure your document root.
